There isn't a universally agreed-upon name for a sub-item in a phase of a project that has tasks as sub-items. However, here are some common options you might encounter:

- **Subtask:** This is a general term used in many project management tools and methodologies.
- **Work package:** This term suggests a small, well-defined unit of work within a larger project phase.
- **Deliverable:** This term is used when the sub-item represents a specific output or outcome expected from that part of the project.
- **Milestone:** This term is used when the sub-item marks a specific point in the project's progress.
Ultimately, the best term depends on the specific project management methodology and the context of your project.

In the context of app development project management, here are some common terms for a sub-item in a phase that has tasks as sub-items:

- **User story:** This is a common term in Agile methodologies, which are popular in app development. A user story describes a specific functionality of the app from the user's perspective. It can be broken down into smaller tasks for developers to complete.
- **Feature:** This term refers to a broader set of functionalities within the app. It can be further broken down into user stories or tasks.
Epic (sometimes referred to as Capability): This is a large, complex feature that may span multiple development phases. It can be further decomposed into features and user stories.
The specific term you use will depend on the level of detail you're working with and the development methodology you're following. Here's a breakdown of how they might be used:

Example

- **Epic:** "Implement a login and authentication system"
- **Feature:** "User login" (within the "Implement a login and authentication system" epic)
- **User story:** "As a user, I want to be able to log in with my email address and password" (within the "User login" feature)
- **Task:** "Develop functionality to validate email format" (a subtask within the "As a user, I want to be able to log in with my email address and password" user story)


# Breakdown

Here's a breakdown of how project, phase, epic, feature, and task are used in app development, especially within Agile methodologies:

**Project:**  This is the big picture, the entire app you're developing. It encompasses all the work from initial concept to final launch and potentially even future updates.

**Phase:**  A project is typically divided into smaller, more manageable phases. These phases represent distinct stages in the development process,  like "Planning," "Design," "Development," "Testing," and "Deployment." Each phase has a specific goal and set of deliverables.

**Epic (or Capability):**  This is a large, complex feature that contributes significantly to the overall functionality of the app.  Epics usually span multiple development phases and require significant effort to complete. They represent a significant user benefit or a major technical hurdle. 

**Feature:**  A feature is a discrete piece of functionality within the app. It delivers a specific value to the user and can be independently developed, tested, and deployed.  Features are smaller and more focused than epics. 

**Task:**  A task is the most granular element. It's a specific, actionable item that needs to be completed to deliver a feature or user story. Tasks are typically assigned to individual developers or designers and can be estimated in terms of time or effort. 

Here's an example to illustrate the hierarchy:

* **Project:** Develop a new social media app

* **Phase:** Design (This phase might focus on creating the user interface mockups)
    * **Epic:** Implement a news feed system (This epic requires functionalities like fetching data, displaying posts, and handling user interactions)
        * **Feature:** Display a scrollable list of posts (This feature contributes to the news feed system)
            * **User story:**  "As a user, I want to see a scrollable list of posts from my friends and followed accounts in the news feed."  
                * **Task:** Develop logic to fetch and display posts chronologically.
                * **Task:** Design the layout for individual posts in the news feed.

As you can see, each level breaks down the work into smaller, more manageable chunks. This helps development teams stay organized, track progress, and ensure they're building an app that meets user needs.
